# Lunar Solar Panel Simulator

A MATLAB-based tool for simulating and optimizing the positioning of solar panels on the Moon. This simulator estimates solar energy generation over time at a given lunar location, accounting for shadowing, thermal conditions and the Sun's motion. It also includes a module for optimizing panel orientation and positioning to maximize energy yield during a mission period.

## Features

- Simulation of solar energy yield based on time, position, and environmental conditions
- Shadow analysis and thermal modeling for realistic performance estimation
- Optimization module for panel placement (experimental, currently slow)
- Modular structure for integrating terrain data or mission-specific inputs

## Use Cases

- Lunar mission planning and rover energy budgeting
- Academic research in extraterrestrial energy systems
- Visualization of solar availability in different lunar regions

## Roadmap

- Improve speed and scalability of optimization
- Integration with external simulation frameworks
